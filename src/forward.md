I am just a student taking notes with hopes of passing a class. For my benefit, I will try to make my notes as correct as possible, but you should expect plenty of errors and parts that do not make sense.

```admonish warning
I am not a good student, so don't expect good notes.

## My Class
The book we are using is "Yo Soy As√≠" third edition.

My 101 class will only cover the first 5 chapters of the book.
