# Learning-Spanish
A place to keep my Spanish Notes.

## About Me
I am taking a developer that is taking a Spanish 101 course later in life. Due to my professional habits, it is hard to take notes in a traditional manner.

## My Notes
I am going to try to write my notes using mdbook. Here is my [github pages link](https://crazcalm.github.io/Learning-Spanish/)

### Rending book
```
mdbook server --open
```


### Mdbook
My goal is try write my notes in [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/tree/master).

**Note**: Both their user guide and test book are very informative.
