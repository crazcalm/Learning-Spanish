# Demonstrative Adjectives

Demonstrative adjectives are used to state the postition of people or things to which the speaker is referring. They must agree with the gender and number of the noun they modify. In English we use *this* or *these* to indicate that the object is near the speaker, and *that* or *those* to indicate that the objext is at some distance from the speak. Spanish also uses a third adjective to distinguish between the distance of two or more nouns that relate to the speaker or the listener.

|Masculine|Feminine||
|**Este** coche|**Esta** casa| This|
|**Ese** coche|**Esa** casa|That|
|**Aquel** coche|**Aquella** casa|That (far)|
|**Estos** coches|**Estas** casas|These|
|**Esos** coches|**Esas** casas|Those|
|**Aquellos** coches|**Aquellas** casas|Those (far)|

It is also common to use the adverbs *aquí* (here), *allí* (there), and *allá* (over there) with demonstrative adjectives to further emphasize the distance.

- Este coche aquí es barato, pero ese coche allí es caro.
  - This car is cheap, but that car is expensive.

- Aquellos coches allá son los más caros.
  - Those cars over there are the most expensive.
