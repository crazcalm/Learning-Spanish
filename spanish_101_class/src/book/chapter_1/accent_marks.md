# Acentuacíon

Not all words in Spanish need an accent mark or *tilde*!. Generally, the accent mark denotes the phonetic emphases on a given syllable if the word does not follow the natural stress on that particular syllable. In other words, as accent mark expresses an exception to the following rules.

## Rule 1:

Words ending in any of the five vowels or consonants **n** or **s** carry the stress on the next to last syllable:

- mu**cha**cho
- E**le**na
- ele**fan**te
- ca**qui**
- **Ca**rmen
- mu**cha**chos

## Rule 2:

All other words ending in a consonant (except **n** or **s**) are stressed on the Last syllable:

- ron**car**
- apti**tud**
- Bra**sil**
- fri**jol**
- Inter**net**


## Rule 3:

Then, if a word carries the stress on a different syllable, it must show the accent mark on the vowel of the syllable that is stressed:

- in**glés**
- **glán**dula
- **pá**jaro
- glo**tón**
- **clí**max

## Rule 4:

All words in Spanish that are stressed on the third or fourth syllables must be written with an accent mark:

- Cu**én**tamelo
- cen**tí**metro
- **clá**usula
- **lám**para
- en**tré**gaselo


## Not a Rule but still Important:

There is a final use of the *tilde* or accent mark. Certain words have the same spelling, but have different meanings. Then, an accent mark is used to differentiate their meaning:


| Word 1| Word 2|
-------|-----|
|él = he| el = the|
|tú = you| tu = your|
|sí = yes| si = if|
|más = more| mas = but|
|sólo = only| solo = alone|
|aún = moreover| aun = even|
|té = tea| te = you (object pronoun)|
